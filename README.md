Keystone is a field-first construction project management platform built for small and mid-sized teams.

It focuses on the core workflows that actually matter on a jobsite:
- daily reports
- project files
- basic team and project coordination

The goal is to replace paper, spreadsheets, and scattered tools with a single, simple system that is fast to use in the field and reliable for project leaders.

## Status

**Work in progress**

Keystone is currently under active development as a staged MVP.  
APIs, features, and UX are evolving as the platform is built.

This repository contains the source code and internal specifications used to develop the platform.
